<h1 align="left">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Valerie</h1>
<h3 align="left">I am a curious and energetic full-stack software engineer who is an expert at finding bugs and decent at fixing them, too. Here are a handful of things I've been up to recently:</h3>

 - __Architectural Transformation__ â€“ Modernized a legacy job processing system with AWS Step Functions, SQS, SNS, and automated EC2 management, enhancing scalability and reducing operational overhead.

- __Infrastructure Modernization__ â€“ Migrated Terraform to AWS CDK, introduced dynamic environment variables, and consolidated 1,440+ lines of code for efficient AWS Secrets management.

- __CI/CD and DevOps Enhancements__ â€“ Standardized CI/CD pipelines, integrated Tidelift for automated dependency management, and developed onboarding documentation to improve developer experience.

- __End-to-End Pipeline Development__ â€“ Designed and delivered a file processing pipeline using GitLab CI/CD, AWS CDK, Step Functions, Lambda, and GDAL, incorporating error handling, queue management, and programmatic redactions.

- __Metrics & Monitoring Dashboards__ â€“ Built Sumo Logic and CloudFront dashboards to analyze app errors, malicious IPs, and traffic metrics, improving monitoring and operational visibility.
